# Overview

As a growing software engineer, I’m focused on developing practical, real-world applications that strengthen my problem-solving and front-end development skills.

This project — **Task Tracker** — is a browser-based JavaScript application that helps users stay organized by managing their daily tasks. It allows users to **add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete**. Tasks can also be **sorted by priority, due date, or creation time**.

My purpose for creating this software is to deepen my understanding of **JavaScript fundamentals** such as **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **data persistence** using **localStorage**. This project also helps me practice writing **modular, reusable code** while building an **intuitive and responsive user interface**.




## Development Environment

I developed this software using the following tools and technologies:

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** – main code editor  
- **Live Server** extension – to run and test the app in the browser  
- **Google Chrome** – for debugging and UI testing  
- **Git & GitHub** – for version control and project publishing  

**Programming Languages Used:**
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – logic, event handling, and localStorage persistence  
- **HTML5** – page structure and form controls  
- **CSS3** – styling, layout, and dark/light theme toggle  
- Toastify.js Library (via CDN)
